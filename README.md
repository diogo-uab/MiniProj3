# MiniProj3

New `Sponsor` and `Expert` entites developed on Animalec [backend](./backend/) (`./backend`).

### Postman
The endpoints to manage the new entities can be tested with the included [Postman Collection](./Animalec.postman_collection.json) (`./Animalec.postman_collection.json`).

### Swagger
Swagger files that document the new endpoint are also included, both in [JSON](./backend/swagger.json) (`./backend/swagger.json`) and [YAML](./swagger.yml) (`./swagger.yml`) format.

The Swagger UI is served by the backend using [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express), and can be accessed at `/api-docs` ([http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)).
